Hello,

my name is **Mikołaj Ryśkiewicz**.

I am PhD in jurisprudence student at the University of Warsaw -- where I am working on a research project which aims to analyze the connections between instability and incomprehensibilty of law.

I work as a Data Scientist and pursue my career in data science and machine learning.
